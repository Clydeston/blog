pe file important header
.text - instructions taht cpu executes all other sections store data generlly only section which can execute only section which has code 
.rdata - contains import and export information 
covers different types of sections ina pe file 

<h1>Pages 20-30</h1>
<p>The first five or so pages go over the PE header and some key information to be aware of, such as the different sections and certain values which can help with malware analysis.
  A good tool for view .rsrc section info is mentioned <b>resource hacker</b>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time Date Stamp IMAGE_FILE_HEADER - tells when the executable was compiled (can be easily manipulated)</li>
  <li>Subsystem IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER - will essentially tell us if the program is gui or console based</li>
  <li>Section headers describe info about a pe files sections - the rarely change - easily identifiable if the program has been packed as these values can be different</li>  
</ul>

<p>Quick rundown of PE sections</p>
<ul>
  <li>.text - contains executable code (usually only executable section)</li>
  <li>.rdata - read only data</li>
  <li>.data - global data not just read only</li>
  <li>.idata - sometimes present stores import info - if not present import info stored in .rdata</li>
  <li>.edata - sometimes present and stores export info - if not present export info stored in .rdata</li>
  <li>.pdata - x64 only stores exception handling info</li>
  <li>.rsrc - resource info e.g. icon files</li>
  <li>.reloc stores information needed for relocations</li>
</ul>

<p>I will update this blog further soon once I've completed the first lab</p>
